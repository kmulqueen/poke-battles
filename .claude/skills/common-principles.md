# Common Principles

These principles apply across all domains.

## Focus

- Work within a single domain at a time
- Avoid mixing backend and frontend concerns
- Prefer clear boundaries over convenience

## Clarity

- Make assumptions explicit
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Prefer simple, direct solutions

## Behavior Over Implementation

- Optimize for observable behavior
- Avoid coupling to internal details
- Favor designs that survive refactors

## Incremental Progress

- Make small, reviewable changes
- Keep plans explicit and stepwise
- Prefer steady improvement over large rewrites

## Tooling Discipline

- Let agents follow their defined roles
- Planners plan, executors execute, reviewers review
- Avoid role overlap unless explicitly requested
