# Frontend Architecture

This skill defines frontend architectural conventions.

## Component Design

- Components are small and composable
- Components over abstractions
- Components reflect document structure
- Business logic lives outside presentational components

## HTML & Accessibility

- Prefer semantic HTML elements
- Use divs only when no semantic element fits

## State & Data Flow

- UI state and domain state are clearly separated
- Local state by default
- Avoid premature global state
- Explicit data flow

## Composition

- Prefer hooks and composition over inheritance
